## Overview

A module for upgrading Puppet agents. Supports upgrading from Puppet 4 puppet-agent packages to later versions.

## Module Description

The puppet_agent module installs the Puppet Collection 1 repo (as a default, and on systems that support repositories); migrates configuration required by Puppet to new locations used by puppet-agent; and installs the puppet-agent package, removing the previous Puppet installation.

If a package_version parameter is provided, it will ensure that puppet-agent version is installed. The package_version parameter is required to perform upgrades starting from a puppet-agent package.

## Setup

### What puppet_agent affects

* Puppet, Facter, Hiera, and MCollective.
* Puppet's SSL directory and puppet.conf.
* Removes deprecated settings from puppet.conf.

### Setup requirements

Your agents must be running a minimum version of Puppet 4. They should already be pointed at a master running Puppet Server 2.1 or greater, and thus successfully applying catalogs compiled with the Puppet 4 language.

### Beginning with puppet_agent

Install the puppet_agent module with `puppet module install puppetlabs-puppet_agent`.

## Usage

Add the class to agents you want to upgrade, specifying the desired puppet-agent version:

~~~puppet
class {'::puppet_agent':
  package_version => '1.4.0',
}
~~~

This will ensure the version `1.4.0` of the puppet-agent package is installed. For version `1.4.0` and later, it will also remove the deprecated `pluginsync` setting from `puppet.conf`, unless explicitly managed elsewhere.

## Reference

### Public classes
* [`puppet_agent`](#class-puppetagent)

### Private classes
* `puppet_agent::install`: Installs packages.
* `puppet_agent::osfamily::*`: Platform-specific preparation performed before upgrades.
* `puppet_agent::prepare`: Prepares the agent for upgrade.
* `puppet_agent::prepare::package`: Stages packages locally for install, on platforms that can't install from remote packages.
* `puppet_agent::prepare::*`: Prepare various file configurations.
* `puppet_agent::service`: Ensures the services are running.
* `puppet_agent::windows::install`: Handles Windows package installation.

### Parameters

#### Class: puppet_agent

##### `arch`

The architecture version you wish to install. Defaults to `$::facts['architecture']`.
``` puppet
  arch => 'x86_64'
```

##### `collection`

The Puppet Collection to track, should be one of `puppet5` or `puppet6`.  Puppet collections contain the latest agents included
in the collection's series, so the latest 5 series in puppet5 (for example: 5.5.10) and the latest 6 series in puppet6 (for
example: 6.1.0).  **This parameter is required for installations not connected to PE**
``` puppet
  collection => 'puppet6'
```

##### `is_pe`

Install from Puppet Enterprise repos. Enabled if communicating with a PE master.
``` puppet
  is_pe => true
```

##### `manage_repo`

Boolean to determine whether to configure zypper/yum/apt/solaris repositories. Defaults to `true`.
If set to false, it is assumed an internally hosted repository will be used for the installation,
and the native package providers will be used to query pre-configured repos on the host being upgraded.
``` puppet
  manage_repo => true
```

##### `package_version`

The package version to upgrade to. This must be explicitly specified.
``` puppet
  package_version => '5.5.8'
```

##### `service_names`

An array of services to start, normally `puppet`. If the array is empty, no services are started.
``` puppet
  service_names => ['puppet']
```

##### `source`

Alternate source from which you wish to download the latest version of Puppet. On the Windows operating system this is the absolute path to the MSI file to install, for example:
``` puppet
  source => 'C:/packages/puppet-agent-1.7.0-x64.msi'
```

##### `install_dir`

The directory the puppet agent should be installed to. This is only applicable for Windows operating systems and when upgrading the agent to a new version; it will not cause re-installation of the same version to a new location. This must use backslashes for the path separator, and be an absolute path, for example:
``` puppet
  install_dir => 'D:\Program Files\Puppet Labs'
```

##### `install_options`

An array of additional options to pass when installing puppet-agent. Each option in the array can be either a string or a hash. Each option is automatically quoted when passed to the install command.

With Windows packages, note that file paths in `install_options` must use backslashes. (Since install options are passed directly to the installation command, forward slashes aren't automatically converted like they are in `file` resources.) Backslashes in double-quoted strings _must_ be escaped, while backslashes in single-quoted strings _can_ be escaped. The default value for Windows packages is `REINSTALLMODE="maus"`.
``` puppet
  install_options => ['PUPPET_AGENT_ACCOUNT_DOMAIN=ExampleCorp','PUPPET_AGENT_ACCOUNT_USER=bob','PUPPET_AGENT_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD=password']
```

##### `msi_move_locked_files`

This is only applicable for Windows operating systems. There may be instances where file locks cause unncessary service restarts.  By setting to true, the module will move files prior to installation that are known to cause file locks. By default this is set to false.

``` puppet
  msi_move_locked_files => true
```

### Tasks

#### `puppet_agent::version`

Checks for the version of puppet-agent package installed. Returns results as `{"version": "<ver>", "source": "<how version was
detected>"}`. If a version cannot be found, returns `{"version": null}`.

#### `puppet_agent::install`

Installs the puppet-agent package. Currently only supports Linux variants: Debian, Ubuntu, SLES, RHEL/CentOS/Fedora. A specific
package `version` can be specified; if not, will install or upgrade to the latest Puppet 5 version available.

**Note**: The `puppet_agent::install_shell` task requires the `facts::bash` implementation from the [facts](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/facts) module. Both the `puppet_agent` and `facts` modules are packaged with Bolt. For use outside of Bolt make sure the `facts` module is installed to the same `modules` directory as `puppet_agent`.

## Limitations

Mac OS X Open Source packages are currently not supported.

### Known issues

* In masterless environments, modules installed manually on individual agents cannot be found after upgrading to Puppet 4.x. You should reinstall these modules on the agents with `puppet module install`.

In addition, there are several known issues with Windows:

* To upgrade the agent by executing `puppet agent -t` interactively in a console, you must leave the console open and wait for the upgrade to finish before attempting to use the `puppet` command again. During upgrades the upgrade scripts use a 'pid file' located at Drive:\ProgramData\PuppetLabs\puppet\cache\state\puppet_agent_upgrade.pid to indicate there is an upgrade in progress. The 'pid file' also contains the process ID of the upgrade, if you wish to track the process itself.

* MSI installation failures do not produce any error. If the install fails, puppet_agent continues to be applied to the agent. If this happens, you'll need to examine the MSI log file to determine the failure's cause. You can find the location of the log file in the debug output from either a puppet apply or an agent run; the log file name follows the pattern `puppet-<timestamp>-installer.log`.

Specifically in the 1.2.0 Release:
* For Windows, you must trigger an agent run after upgrading so that Puppet can create the necessary directory structures.

## Development

Puppet, Inc. modules on the Puppet Forge are open projects, and community contributions are essential for keeping them great. We canâ€™t access the huge number of platforms and myriad hardware, software, and deployment configurations that Puppet is intended to serve. We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes so that our modules work in your environment. There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things. For more information, see our [module contribution guide.](https://docs.puppet.com/forge/contributing.html)
